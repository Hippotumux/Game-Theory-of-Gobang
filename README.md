Abstract—Gobang, an abstract strategy board game, is played
on a 15x15 Go board where the objective is to connect five stones
in a row to win. I aspire to create a program similar to AlphaGo,
allowing the computer to play chess against me, therefore I am
motivated to develop my own computerized Gobang game for
challenging player interactions. Therefore, this project involves
developing a computerized Gobang game.
